# MOVIES RECOMMENDER
 
It's a Web Base Movie Recommendation Engine which is using Collaborative Filtering By matrix factorizations algorithm to recommend closest match. 

The recommendation is based on the underlying idea that is if two persons both liked a common genre of movies, then this will recommend movies that one person has liked but other one hasn't seen it yet.

## FLOW OF PROJECT:


Firstly I have taken movies dataset from TMDB DATABASE

LINK : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata


Then, the preprocessing of data was done in JUPYTER NOTEBOOK.

After that we bulid the model and made website(local host) using STREAMLIT LIBRARY in PYCHARM(python IDE).


## TECHNOLOGIES USED:


To make website I have used STREAMLIT library IN PYTHON. You can also use FLASK.

## MACHINE LEARNING LIBRARY In Python3


Numpy, Pandas, Pickles, Requests.


## How to extrat the code to your local computer:


Just go and download the file.

In the file their is a .zip file named movie-recommendation-sytem, unzip that and run it on any python supported IDE.

You can also try implementing jupyter files in Jupyter notebook. It's always better to explore the project yourself.

NOTE : You will have to download libraries like numpy, pandas, streamlit etc.. If you haven't already!

## FLOW OF PROJECT:


Firstly I have taken movies dataset from TMDB DATABASE

LINK : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata


Then, the preprocessing of data was done in JUPYTER NOTEBOOK.

After that we bulid the model and made website(local host) using STREAMLIT LIBRARY in PYCHARM(python IDE).


## TECHNOLOGIES USED:


To make website I have used STREAMLIT library IN PYTHON. You can also use FLASK.

## MACHINE LEARNING LIBRARY In Python3


NUMPY, PANDAS, PICKLES, REQUESTS.


## How to extrat the code to your local computer:


Just go and download the file.

In the file their is a .zip file named movie-recommendation-sytem, unzip that and run it on any python supported IDE.

You can also try implementing jupyter files in Jupyter notebook. It's always better to explore the project yourself.

NOTE : You will have to download libraries like numpy, pandas etc.. If you haven't yet!

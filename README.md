## FLOW OF PROJECT:


FIRSTLY I HAVE TAKE MOVIES DATASET FROM TMDB DATABASE

LINK : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata


THEN, THE PREPROSSING OF DATA WAS DONE IN JUPYTER NOTEBOOK.

AFTER THAT WE BULID THE MODEL AND MADE WEBSITE USING STREAMLIT LIBRARY IN PYCHARM.


## TECHNOLOGIES USED:


TO MAKE WEBSITE I HAVE USED STREAMLIT LIBRARY IN PYTHON. YOU CAN ALSO YOU FLASK.

## MACHINE LEARNING LIBRARY In Python3


NUMPY, PANDAS, PICKLES, REQUESTS.


## How to extrat the code to your local computer:


Just go and download the file.


In the file their is a .zip file named movie-recommendation-sytem, unzip that and run it on any python supported IDE.

You can also try implementing jupyter files in Jupyter notebook. It's always better to explore all the project yourself.

NOTE : You will have to download libraries like numpy, pandas etc.. If you haven't yet!
